For the first eight years of his life, Orestes’ family barely got by, but they worked hard enough and saved enough money to move to America. Orestes was named the captain of his high school baseball team, served as a leader in Key Club, and ranked at the top of his class. He attends University of Notre Dame where he plans to study engineering like his father.</div>

      <div class="__body">Throughout high school, Vivian Nguyen was a stellar athlete, student, and leader. She was the President of Ridge Athletes for Literacy, a club that brings high school students into elementary schools to promote the value of reading. Under Vivian’s leadership, she expanded the club to include over 100 students from her school and built partnerships with several local elementary classrooms. Vivian’s strength was tested when she lost both her grandmother and her mother to cancer within the same year. At the time, Vivian also learned she might be a carrier of BRCA 2, a genetically inherited gene that increases her risk of breast cancer. Despite the loss and her daunting possibility of cancer, Vivian found the courage to fight for a bright future. Vivian attends Howard Page University and hopes to pursue a career in oncology, so she can help families like hers.</div>
